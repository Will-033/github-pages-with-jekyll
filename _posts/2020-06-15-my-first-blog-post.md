Brag sheet

1. I play soccer. I have been playing for about eleven years now. I play for the township team. It is extremely fun and exciting.
2. I play the violin. I have been playing for six years now. Being in an orchestra is fantastic, and playing music is somewhat liberating for me.
3. I have volunteered in various places over the past two years including, heavenly farms, playhouse 22, and many elementary schools.
